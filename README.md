classify6

An OCAML command line tool to classify IPv6 addresses, and provide a bit of further information.

Easy deployment options for testers:

apt-get install ocaml git-core											
git clone https://github.com/blackswanburst/classify6.git				
cd classify6																							

To compile for bytecode for usage with ocamlrun:
ocamlbuild Classify6.byte								
or to compile natively:
ocamlbuild Classify6.native								

How could you help?
